## Simple chat app. It has basic node.js server with websocket for messaging and Flutter app.
1. Run Backend:
- Check if you have node.js and npm:
```
node -v

npm -v
```
- Install dependencies. Navigate to node.js server folder. Run: ```npm install```.
- Run the server: node server.js

2. Run Flutter app:

- Run 2 apps.

- Log in as: user1 and user2.

- Start messaging.


Limitations:
1. Really simple authentication, due to the lack of backend knowledge.
2. Would be great to have different chats of users. I couldn't find proper websocket backend API, so I created it on my self. However it's super simple and every user gets message.
